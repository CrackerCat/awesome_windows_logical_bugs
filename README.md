# awesome_windows_logical_bugs
create this repo for the people who want to learn about windows logical privilege escalation bugs. <br>And also I added some of my findings. You can contact me via [@404death](https://twitter.com/404death) to add good article which I missed. <br> 
`work in progress (WIP) , I'm always update this repo when the new bugs release.`
